        <div class="search-item"> <p>Abalindi Welfare Society is a non-profit organization established in 1970 in the Amatikwe community, based in Durban, KZN. 
                The organization primarily focuses on people over the age of 60 who have been abused or not taken care of by their family members. After a few years, they decided to include children in the society, aged 0–18 years old, referred by district social workers, for the society to care for them. The organization 
                showed its success and decided to create a creche which has also become successful. Abalindi Welfare is a very Christian-centered organization, to an extent that they host a Seventh-day Adventist church every Saturday, which is Amatikwe SDA church. They also welcome the Children of the Sea home and Abalindi Elders to come.
            </p> 
            <p>Abalindi Welfare Society has ventured into different business opportunities such as creating a well-known bakery in the area in order to gain funds
                for the organization. They further created a Creche known as the Thokozani Creche where the community could take their children to learn, and they provide them with aftercare services. 
            </p>
            <p>This initiative created job opportunities for the community which made the organization realize how jobs were needed in the community. 
                So they decided to open:

                    <li>Sewing project</li>

                </ol><!--ol is used to make a list -->
            </p>
